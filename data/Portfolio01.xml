			</About>
			<Background>
				<ak>KAS already has many databases, electronic registries, including backups, deployed on different servers and managed with advanced IT applications and systems. Also, ASK is in the process of preparing the Census of 2021 for the Population, Households, and Housing. IT will be included to assist at all stages of the census, especially new technologies that can be used for data collection, processing, and dissemination activities.
Our focus for this audit will be on assessing whether the IT division has managed to manage electronic operations and systems efficiently and effectively to support the achievement of ASK strategic planning objectives. </ak>
			</Background>
			<Scope>
				<ak>The scope of this audit will be the Kosovo Agency of Statistics. The main focus will be on the Department of Methodology and Information Technology which is responsible for the creation, development, management, and maintenance of the Information Technology Statistical System as well as the Electronic Statistical Records.

Also to verify that ASK staff has sufficient information and applies good information security practices, there will be interviewed staff of departments operating within ASK.

This audit covers the period 2019 and the year 2020 will be covered until the end of the audit.</ak>

					<quote type="description">KAS must have documented, approved and communicated policies, procedures and operational processes in order to guide IT functions and at the same time have mechanisms that ensure that these policies and procedures are being pursued in order to achieve of the organization's objectives.

KAS does not have the necessary policies and standards to establish the rules and regulations for the managerial, operational and administrative frameworks of IT. IT officials at KAS had succeeded in managing their work processes to some extent, but without following any written process. Although IT officials supported and were involved in all phases of statistical projects, this process of cooperation between departments and activities that IT officials had to follow during the phases of statistical projects was not documented, and for this part they were based on the MZHePS model . 

Due to their non-drafting, KAS had considered sufficient the AIS guidelines and regulations as well as the EUROSTAT standards on which they were based for the issue of statistics. However, even these are not enough for the internal operations that take place in KAS. Furthermore, the AIS guidelines and regulations apply to a large extent to the KAS, and as a result of their non-application, shortcomings have been noted.  

Lack of well-defined policies, procedures and processes risks in the organization not providing a basis to analyze how to move from their existing state to targeted objectives. Their absence makes it impossible to identify gaps or limitations in resources, communications between departments, technology or the ability to control and correct risks related to work processes.

				<Case nr="F20200221-133549" nm="Not adequate segregation of duties" eff="KAS has failed to create an adequate division of staff duties and responsibilities in the field of information technology." act="" doc="" Include="Yes">
					<cts source="AITAM" domain="01 IT Governance" area="03 Organisational structures, Standards, Policies and Procedures" issue="01 Structure of the IT Organization"/>
					<quote type="description">The IT department should be positioned in such a way that the division of tasks includes all the functions to achieve the objectives of the KAS. . In addition, KAS should have mechanisms in place to determine, monitor, and control IT performance. .
KAS has not made adequate allocation of staff duties and responsibilities in the field of Information Technology. During the audit process, it was noticed that KAS has divided the IT Division within the Department of Methodology and Information Technology, but there is no adequate division of labor tasks. All IT staff performs all the work related to information technology. 
Also based on job descriptions, the IT division has not covered the position of Database Administrator, nor has it provided for the position of desk assistant. Inadequate division of work responsibilities and failure to fill positions can affect the failure to achieve the goals and needs of KAS, can result in various errors with the inability to identify or even possible misuse of the job position by not performing tasks for which adequate staff is assigned. 
In addition to the employees in the IT division, KAS has three IT officials located in other departments, where according to the job description they are responsible for the systems and databases only for the department they are engaged in. And consequently the databases (which are many in number) that are not under their responsibility, remain as additional work for officials in the IT division. Failure to cover all relevant responsibilities with staff poses a risk of improper performance of tasks and goals. 
From the analysis of contracts and job descriptions of IT-responsible staff, changes have been observed between the job position and the job description. In addition, the staff recruited during the period 2019 under the responsibility of IT, have not received the necessary information and training regarding the work process and information security and as a result have made various mistakes during the execution of work (presented in the following findings). Furthermore, job descriptions are not signed by the staff responsible for carrying out these tasks. Failure to sign the duties and responsibilities and not informing the new staff recruited with the work processes and providing relevant training, may affect the non-fulfillment of tasks and failure to achieve the goals of KAS adequately. 
Failure to harmonize job positions and descriptions has led to a lack of control over staff responsibilities. Meanwhile, the lack of training for the recruited new staff occurs as a lack of identification of needs and design of internal procedures

					<quote type="description">KAS should have documented procedures and processes for detecting and recording irregular conditions related to the management of IT incidents and problems. . KAS should establish mechanisms for detecting and documenting conditions that could lead to the identification of an incident, these mechanisms are intended to prevent incidents or similar problems in the future. .
KAS has not drafted a procedure for the identification, management and treatment of incidents and problems of information technology, nor has it developed processes or systems related to the collection, treatment, management and storage of incidents and problems of information technology. 
Furthermore, KAS has not established mechanisms in order to identify various problems and incidents in IT systems, such as unauthorized access by users, various interventions in systems and networks (security), system and network failures (operational), low program function (service delivery) or lack of user skills. 
KAS did not have a register of problems and incidents that occur, in order to prevent and minimize their recurrence. Although according to IT officials, in the past they had started preparing a system for reporting problems, but the work in it was interrupted due to other priority works that had occurred in KAS. As a result of the lack of such a system, KAS did not have the necessary knowledge on the frequent problems that occurred, the training in the field of IT that KAS personnel needed, and there was a lack of an accurate overview of the needs of KAS in the field of IT in general. 
The lack of procedures and mechanisms related to the identification, reporting, management and treatment of IT incidents and problems, leaves the possibility of not treating them at all, not correctly identifying and treating them in time, minimizing any problems or incidents that may occur and may have consequences in IT systems.

				<Case nr="F20200221-135539" nm="Lack of policy, procedure and process regarding change management" eff="KAS has not established a process for managing changes in information systems, including the management of emergency changes that may occur " act="" doc="" Include="Yes">
					<cts source="AITAM" domain="02 IT Operations" area="04 Change Management" issue="01 Policy"/>
					<quote type="description">KAS must follow a defined procedure of change management, which requires approval before implementation in the operational environment. The change management process should ensure that changes are recorded, evaluated, authorized, prioritized, planned, tested, implemented, documented, and reviewed in accordance with documented and approved change management procedures. . KAS should also have established procedures for emergency changes .
During the audit process of the IT Division in KAS, it was noticed that a procedure is missing which deals with the issues of managing changes in hardware and software systems. Changes are made depending on the request of the project by the relevant managers through e-mails or direct contacts, but the same do not always go through the necessary stages to make the changes such as: planning, approval, implementation, testing, transition to a productive environment, withdrawal plan etc. In addition, KAS has not established a process regarding emergency changes. All this is done without any trace of change.
The lack of a procedure related to change management, leaves the possibility of not realizing the changes according to a defined plan, and there is the possibility of unapproved and inadequate changes. In addition, the lack of procedure for emergency changes can affect inadequate changes as a result of emergency changes. These shortcomings can affect a non-fully functional system and can have operational and financial consequences for KAS.

				<Case nr="F20200221-135641" nm="There are no test environments  to validate controls within the applications before put in production" eff="KAS has not created a test environment to test developed systems before it is switched to a productive environment, and the staff responsible for development has constant access to productive environments " act="" doc="" Include="Yes">
					<cts source="AITAM" domain="02 IT Operations" area="04 Change Management" issue="01 Policy"/>
					<quote type="description">KAS should have a test environment for testing developments in systems before they pass into a productive environment . Access to productive environments should be limited, all developments should be done in a different environment from the productive one, and only after the final testing phase, the same should pass in the productive environment. 
In KAS, in the absence of the procedure for managing changes and the lack of a test environment, testing in the system for recording agricultural surveys has been done directly in the production/productive environment. In addition, the staff responsible for the development of systems in KAS has constant access to central data systems and databases and in this way can make continuous changes without any supervision and without being noticed. As for the changes in the KAS systems that are made, the requests for continuous change of the system by the management are not approved. In the absence of a written process and in the absence of the implementation of good practices, all tests are performed in the production/productive environment and access to them was complete.
Testing of systems in a productive environment poses a risk of incorrect identification of errors, as well as a risk of damage to the system developed during the testing phase. While the lack of approval of changes by management and the constant approach of staff responsible for system development in productive environments, there is a risk of uncontrolled and unsupervised changes.

				<Case nr="F20200221-140830" nm="There are no validation rules within the application" eff="In KAS systems there is a lack of establishing rules for the validity of input data in systems " act="" doc="" Include="Yes">
					<cts source="AITAM" domain="02 IT Operations" area="04 Change Management" issue="01 Policy"/>
					<quote type="description">Systems developed in KAS should be well-designed so that invalid input data is rejected by the system. . Input controls are mainly used to check the integrity of the data entered in an application that is in use, if the data is entered directly by the staff or through an application or interface activated by the Web . 
During the verification of the incoming controls of the applications, it was noticed that from the control of the three systems (Application of entering the data of the agricultural survey, the investment survey and the orchard survey) in two of them there is a lack of setting the validity rules. In two of the three cases tested, the application was built to accept values that did not match the basic data. 
From the control of the application for the registration of agricultural surveys, it has been noticed that this application has not been constructed in a regular manner, since the same has not adequately created the input controls. During the testing and direct observation of the work in this application, it was found that in the fields which were dedicated to the introduction of only numerical characters, the same allowed the introduction of other characters. The database used by this application was also built in the same way. In the same way it allowed the introduction of alphanumeric characters in fields which in the questionnaire were dedicated and designed only for numbers. 
In addition, during the control of the investment survey conducted in the Survey Solution system, it was similarly observed that the fields required in the design to contain only numbers, the same field in the system was designed to accept text as well. After identifying the deficiencies by the audit team and presenting them to the Agency, improvements were made to the identified parts. 
The shortcomings mentioned above have occurred due to the lack of necessary training for the work processes of the new staff employed during 2019, where both of these systems in which the shortcomings have been observed have been developed by the staff employed in this period. 
Lack of access controls to applications and systems in use for work processes in KAS can be risky and can affect:
-	Unauthorized data entry;
-	Incorrect data entry;
-	Irrelevant data entry;
-	Incomplete data entry; and
-	Double data entry.
These affect the poor performance of staff, process and application. At the same time, it increases the time of data control by the staff responsible for their processing, which leads to delays in extracting results. Furthermore, the lack of input controls can create an unsuitable and dangerous environment for the data entry system or even the execution of various commands with bad intentions such as injecting code into the database (SQL Injection) and damaging the database.</quote>

				<Case nr="F20200221-141056" nm="There is no BCP/DRP in place" eff="KAS does not provide continuity of work processes in case of any natural disaster, human error or failure of information systems" act="" doc="" Include="Yes">
					<cts source="AITAM" domain="02 IT Operations" area="01 IT Service Continuity management" issue="01 Key parameters"/>
					<quote type="description">To ensure that work processes in KAS can be continued without any problems and interruptions in case of any natural disaster or human error / misuse, KAS must have established a plan for the continuation of work processes  and must determine emergency response teams in the event of activation of this plan .
KAS has not developed a business continuity plan, which would be a guide for reacting in the event of disasters or failure of work processes and the primary IT system. Without proper management of the continuity of work processes, process owners, data and systems may not have the necessary and sufficient security that work processes can continue to function after a catastrophic event or failure of primary systems. The lack of a practical and cost-effective program for managing the continuity of work processes increases the risk of KAS failure, in the event of a natural disaster or failure of primary systems.
The ASK did not determine the emergency response teams; furthermore, the roles and responsibilities of the emergency response team have not been defined. The lack of an emergency response team makes it impossible for KAS to return to critical processes in the event of a catastrophic event.
The main work processes should be identified and planned emergency measures according to the circumstances, based on an evaluation of the work processes based on criticism. For the execution of a business continuity plan KAS should have in place an assessment regarding the impact of work processes on the proper functioning of KAS, where the reaction time, time of return, period of losses etc. should be determined. .
KAS did not evaluate the work processes and their impact on KAS (BIA - Business Impact Analysis), nor did it assess the risks that would enable KAS to understand the potential threats in the process of critical activities. Failure to carry out an assessment of the processes and risks posed by those processes makes it impossible for KAS to identify these processes and return to critical processes in the event of a catastrophic event.
In order to have a functioning business continuity plan system, KAS must have a backup of systems and data in a location other than where the basic systems and data for the operation of KAS processes are located.  .
From interviews with people in charge of KAS and direct observations, it is understood that some of the systems are backed up, but stored in the same location as the primary systems or stored in inappropriate and unsafe locations, such as on external personal discs of staff or even in their settlements. Despite maintaining a backup for some systems, the recovery and time point (RPO - Recovery Point Object and RTO - Recovery Time Object) were not specified for them. Lack of backup or storage in inappropriate locations can affect the loss of important data in case of failure of the primary system, as well as storage of backup in staff settlements, can affect the distribution of sensitive data .
The business continuity plan and the IT recovery plan should be tested over a period of time to verify whether the KAS can reverse work processes in the event of a natural disaster or system failure. .
In the absence of a plan and procedure for the continuation of the business, as well as the second reserve center, no testing is done to ensure that the KAS can continue the work processes in case of any disaster; also we were not provided evidence that reserve copies of backup systems have been tested and can be used in the event of a primary system failure. The identified shortcomings pose a risk of failure and loss of records and work processes of KAS.
The lack of a plan for the continuity of work processes has led to the KAS not having established an emergency response team, not assessing the risks in the work processes, in an inadequate system of storing backup systems and data.

					<quote type="description">KAS should establish and document a clear information security policy in line with the objectives of the activity and demonstrate its support and commitment. An information security policy document must be approved and communicated to all parties involved .
KAS does not have an approved information security policy that addresses system security issues, data ownership, sensitive data protection, etc., which would serve as standards for the use of IT resources and security management disciplines. Although a draft document on information security was backed up in 2019 by the Swedish Statistical Office and the "Administrative Instruction on the protection of statistical data and access to micro data", these documents were not yet ready for approval and communication to KAS officials. Also, in the absence of these policies, KAS did not have composition controls on information security. 
The lack of a comprehensive information security policy can lead to inconsistencies regarding how security is defined, configured and implemented throughout the KAS. In addition, KAS risks not being able to administer and protect the infrastructure and sensitive information to unauthorized parties.

KAS had the main system for recording data on CLOUD servers, however it had not signed agreements with the system owners. On the official website of the application "Survey Solution" that KAS used, it was recommended that if the recorded data contains sensitive information the platform should be installed on the local server. KAS, regardless of the type of data, stores and processes all of them on CLOUD servers for a certain period of time. KAS had planned in this form to continue with the processing of data with other major projects and of national importance, without making an effort to examine the capacity and opportunities that AIS can offer, and also without signing of an agreement on the security of this data.
This application was recommended to be used by the World Bank, due to the security that the application itself has as well as the security that these CLOUD servers have. KAS did not consider signing an agreement that would ensure that data is not exposed to unauthorized persons during the period when the data is being processed, and whether it will be destroyed after it is downloaded from these servers. In the absence of agreement with the owners of these servers, KAS does not have control and information that after the termination of access the relevant data is destroyed. In this case, KAS risks the loss and misuse of confidential data stored on cloud servers.

Before starting the development process for a project, the necessary requirements must be identified and specified so that the risks are managed and the chances of success are maximized. .
KAS has drafted the official statistics program 2018-2022 within which the advancement of IT infrastructure capacities is mentioned. However, during the development of the projects, KAS was faced with a lack of IT equipment and needs in the field of IT and there was no clear picture of these needs, on which they would be based on the advancement of the infrastructural capacities of IT as foreseen in the 2018-2022 program. During the physical observations we made, there were project officials who, in the absence of computer equipment, used personal computer equipment to complete the project for which they were engaged. This was due to the non-functioning of the agreement with donors, which was intended, among other things, to supply computer equipment. KAS had made an assessment of the risk in the field of IT where only the need for workspaces, the construction of the server room and the need for stimulating policies for the deficit staff in the field of IT and so far had only carried the server room in the premises of the state data center. 

In the absence of a needs review, security may not be achieved to direct resources toward priority areas. Also, in the absence of risk management planning, the organization's intended target may not be achieved and major projects may fail, the organization's security may be compromised, and efforts may not be made to measure progress in relation to the goals and expectations set.

					<quote type="description">KAS should have a written process, which aims to inform / train, recognize the duties and responsibilities of personnel on information security. In addition, KAS must ensure that the personnel have the necessary knowledge on information security from its recruitment to the termination of employment, and must maintain information security. . KAS has to test staff from time to time on cyber threats, organizing incentives for possible attacks.  
KAS has not established a program of awareness and training related to security awareness from possible cyber attacks on a periodic basis, to promote information security awareness and create a positive security culture. Only the notifications that were delegated by AIS for possible cyber attacks were communicated to the staff. In addition to IT officials, other officials had a marked lack of awareness of the issue, and users were not provided with any training on general requirements and the importance of information security and systems in KAS. This was due to the unspecified and confusing structure of information security responsibilities, also due to the lack of an information security officer, while IT officials had delegated to other officials only basic security information.
Given the importance of data and major projects with state influence that KAS has in the process, it had not assessed the risks associated with information security. Therefore, in the absence of the necessary knowledge on information security, KAS risks being exposed to unauthorized disclosure of information, data theft or information, and consequently the security of information is not monitored.

During the physical verifications of users in the domain, databases and applications, it was found that KAS does not have all the unique and personalized accounts. 
To access the domain there were a total of 21 unified accounts which were used by many employees and, in particular, for contracted employees. The official accounts they used for connection only identified the department where they worked. Whereas the tracking of their activities was unidentifiable, and consequently the monitoring of their activities cannot be done.
Furthermore, when verifying an application for the registration of survey data, all processors use the same credentials/accounts which make it difficult to identify the user for the activities performed. During the audit phase, after the presentation of the situation by the audit team, IT officials had taken measures to change these accounts and open personalized accounts.
Also, the access to the database was done with a generalized account and with the administrator’s access. More than one person had access to them, which makes it impossible to identify their activities in the data. In addition, KAS did not have established tracking mechanisms (audit tracks, revenue review, use of unique identifiers).
The general accounts in the applications had been opened due to testing and as such they still remained open. Whereas the accounts with full administrative access on databases were not changed, as, according to IT officials, a well-secured credential is more secure than the  same personalized credentials used in many applications.
In the absence of accounts being personalized, it is difficult to identify those responsible in case of a potential error or misuse

During the verifications of users’ access, out of 229 official accounts in total, 79 of them were not required to change their passwords at all. Of these, 38 accounts were professional electronic accounts used for application administration, local device administration and official domain management accounts, 21 were official electronic accounts with general credentials used by many officials, 15 were official electronic accounts with personalized credentials of KAS officials while 5 others were unidentifiable official electronic accounts.
Due to the general accounts being used by many officials, no time limit was set for using a password. Also, for the personalized accounts of KAS officials, no time limit was given for changing the password with the justification of easier use at the request of the officials.
Lack of implementation of password change in regular time periods risks that the password of user accounts / ID is detected by unauthorized persons and which may lead to accounts’ misuse.

					<quote type="description">When the employment of the officials is completed/ terminated / suspended, or they change the job or personal data, the personnel unit is obliged to immediately inform the administrator of the official accounts of the respective institution, who takes the necessary actions .
Personnel (HR) officials had not notified the relevant IT official of the closure of the electronic accounts as provided by AG 02/2015 Article 7. As a consequence of this and the lack of implementation of AIS (Agency for Information Society) guidelines for official electronic accounts, during our examinations it was found that users were using each other's electronic accounts and were unaware of the consequences that this action would have.
In one case, it was found that even though the officer had resigned, his official account had been used to supervise and edit the application he created. The official account of a retired official was used after his retirement. In two other cases, the staff that was on unpaid leave, their official accounts were open and moreover were used during their leave. Also, from the tests during the direct observations, it was found that the officials used other people’s official accounts. Also, other interviewed officials claimed to use each other's credentials to complete the work during the absence of other officials on certain days.
The notification of the opening or closing of accounts was done only in cases when the directors of departments asked the IT officials to close those accounts, and it was not done upon the notification from the personnel (HR) office as defined by the guideline. During the audit phase, after the presentation of the situation by the audit team, IT officials undertook measures to close these accounts.
This issue can result in security exposure, such as: compromising the integrity, confidentiality and availability of information assets; non-compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to KSA; loss and misuse of systems and information etc.
The official electronic account is the official account used by the users of the state IT system to access electronic services; The official account is unique to all electronic services including domain, applications, intranet, internet, official email and other official electronic services
For the purpose of verifying users of official accounts and verifying access to systems, a list of employees, including employees with agreements for special services had been requested from the Human Resources office, but except for the total number of employees, they did not have a register of officials engaged with agreements for specific services, including their basic information (such as the start and end date of their engagement, the department where they were engaged, the access they should have to systems etc.). Following our request for verification of accesses to the systems, the register was developed by the Budget and Finance Division. During 2019, KAS hired about 370 officials with agreements for special services, who conducted surveys in the field (this number is expected to increase during 2020, whereas, due to major projects that KAS is planning, this number will increase even more in the future ). Yet, some of them were engaged in other jobs that required access to KAS systems, some of them in different projects in different periods. Their access to the domain was through a general account and their activities were not monitored.
The lack of complete records of officials, as well as the lack of their monitoring, jeopardizes the security level of electronic systems. Such risks may include accidental or intentional destruction of data assets, within or outside the KAS. It also creates room for potential fraud and inability to identify responsible persons in the event of potential error or misuse.
